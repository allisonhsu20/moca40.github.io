Founded in 1980, the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) is dedicated to
preserving and presenting the history, heritage, culture and diverse experiences of
people of Chinese descent in the United States. The greatly expanded MOCA at 215
Centre Street is a national home for the precious narratives of diverse Chinese
American communities, and strives to be a model among interactive museums.

The Museum promotes dialogue and understanding among people of all cultural
backgrounds, bringing 160 years of Chinese American history to vivid life through its
innovative exhibitions, educational and cultural programs. MOCA welcomes diverse
visitors and participants to its broad array of exhibits and programs. MOCA’s expansion
accommodates its range of visitors which include: New Yorkers, domestic and
international visitors, neighborhood residents, students and school groups from local
and regional schools.

Last Year, MOCA began participating in the New York City Marathon as a charitable
partner. Our team of seven runners raised $88,000 to support MOCA’s mission. Many
Chinese American running groups and runners learned about our efforts and showed
their support. We are grateful to them for helping to further our mission in presenting
the stories of Chinese Americans! This year we hope to reach a larger demographic
and raise even more money to support our work.

TCS NYC Marathon MOCA Charity Team 2018

This year will be the 150th anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental
railroad in the United States. To commemorate the contributions of the thousands of
Chinese laborers responsible for this milestone in American history, MOCA has named
its 2019 TCS NYC Marathon fundraising initiative “MOCA Spike 150 - Running Forward
with Our Stories!” We invite fellow runners and non-runners alike to participate in this
initiative. We encourage everyone to help tell the story of some of the first Chinese in
America by helping to support our 2019 marathon team and rewriting history to
acknowledge their contributions.

The MOCA Spike 150 initiative is being led by MOCA Board Co-Chair Jonathan Chu
and Bergen Runners founder and Captain Renny Shih. MOCA Spike 150 kicked off
with a pig run, a half marathon course around lower Manhattan in the shape of a pig, to
commemorate the Lunar New Year and will culminate in the MOCA team crossing the
finish line at the 2019 TCS NYC Marathon. During the nearly yearlong initiative, MOCA
will organize a symbolic relay event to represent the building of the railroad that will
involve Chinese American running groups from across the country. In addition to the
symbolic relay we are planning to tell the stories of 150 significant Chinese Americans
or events in Chinese American history, creating a MOCA TCS NYC Marathon runner
database, recruiting runners to participating in the New York City marathon as a
member of the MOCA Team (this participation will not conflict with runner&#39;s Affiliated
Club at NYRR). The funds raised by the MOCA Team will be used to support the
museum in fulfilling its mission of preserving the history of Chinese Americans and
achieving our goal of becoming a nationally recognized institution. We hope that this initiative will unite Chinese Americans from all across the country and shed light on our contributions throughout American history.  

In addition, MOCA will send a team to document significant Chinese American events
throughout the country. On May 10th , 2019 there will be a large 150th anniversary event
scheduled to take place in Utah commemorating the final spike of the Transcontinental
Railroad. At this event MOCA will announce the start of the Spike Relay, and our
participation in the Boston Marathon (April), NJ marathon (April), San Diego Rock n Roll
Marathon (June), Chicago Marathon (October), and the New York City Marathon
(November).


Kicking off on Feb.10 with 100 runners from 5 local running groups participating in the
pig run, a series of programs will be followed culminating in the MOCA team running the
New York City Marathon. Details are coming soon, please stay tuned! The events and
programs will be posted on a dedicated website. MOCA also plans to document the
initiative and create a documentary to celebrate this momentous occasion. Please join
us as we embark on this long journey 150 years in the making.
