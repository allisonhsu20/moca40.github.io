On January 23, 2020, MOCA’s Collections and Research Center—located at 70 Mulberry Street in Chinatown, New York City which housed over 85,000 artifacts (the “Collections”) of Chinese American history—experienced a devastating 5-alarm fire at its site located at 70 Mulberry Street in Chinatown, New York. MOCA’s main museum is located at 215 Centre Street in Chinatown, New York. Since the devastating fire—and with the guidance, support, and help of New York City agencies and over 400 volunteers—MOCA recovered 95% of the artifacts in its Collections. Meanwhile, MOCA has been receiving post-fire collection's donations below.
