[Waves of Identity: 35 Years of Archiving](http://www.mocanyc.org/about/press/press_release/museum_of_chinese_in_america_to_present_waves_of_identity_35_years_of_arch) was an [exhibition](http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/waves_of_identity) that celebrated MOCA’s 35th anniversary by showcasing artifacts the museum had collected over its history. The exhibition reexamines what it means to be Chinese American, asking the questions, Where Does Chinatown End? How Do You Become An American? and What Does It Mean To Be Chinese? It engaged visitors in a dialogue about their own identities and asked them to actively search for answers within the provided archive materials and objects. Objects across special collections in MOCA’s archives came together with documents, videos, and oral histories that embody the complexities of Chinese Americans in New York Chinatown and beyond. 

["长江后浪推前浪：美国华人35年典藏"](http://www.mocanyc.org/about/press/press_release/museum_of_chinese_in_america_to_present_waves_of_identity_35_years_of_arch) 是一项庆祝美国华人博物馆三十五周年的[展览](http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/waves_of_identity)，其中展示了博物馆多年历史以来收集的各种文物。此展重新考虑了"美国华裔”的意思，其中提出了一系列问题："唐人街的边界在哪里？"，"如何成为美国人？"，和 “做中国人是什么意思？”. 此展鼓励观者进行对于自己身份的对话，且推动观者利用展内提供的物件与资料来寻找答案。美国华人博物馆多数特殊收集中的文物与各种文件，录像，和口述史拼成了纽约唐人街与非唐人街华人们的复杂形象。
