In 2017, MOCA presented FOLD: Golden Venture Paper Sculptures, an updated version of the museum’s 1996 Fly to Freedom exhibit.  The show was revisited as a way to engage the public in conversation about the current climate of  immigration in the US. The exhibition displayed over forty paper sculptures created by Chinese passengers of the cargo ship, the Golden Venture, which ran aground at Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York in 1993.  The sculptures were created during their incarceration in US prisons and depicted caged birds and bald eagles that were meant to symbolize the unrealized American dream that they had hoped for.   Originally these pieces were created as gifts for their lawyers and supporters but as time as has passed these pieces of folk art have become an entry point into a pointed exploration of US immigration policy.  

2017年，美国华人博物馆推出了《折叠：出于黄色冒险号的纸雕》，是博物馆在1996年展览《向着自由飞翔》的基础上更改后的新展览。此展从新鼓励了美国民众来考虑目前美国移民问题。展览列出货船黄色冒险号上后而被监禁的非法移民制作的四十多做纸雕。1993年，黄色冒险号承载了286个来自中共大陆的非法移民， 而在纽约皇后区的洛克威海滩搁浅。船上的移民把纸雕制成笼中鸟和老鹰的形象，代表了他们终而无法实现的美国梦。这些作品本来是将要赠送给他们的律师和支持者的礼品，但久而久之，这些民间作品成为了讨论美国移民政策的一个切入点。
