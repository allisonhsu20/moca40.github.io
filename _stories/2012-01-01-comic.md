In 2012, MOCA presented [two exhibitions](http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/past/marvels_and_monsters_and_altcomics) that trace the depictions of Asian Americans in comics;  Marvels and Monsters: Unmasking Asian Images in U.S. Comics, 1942-1986 and Alt. Comics: Asian American Artists Reinvent the Comic.  They were shown simultaneously to compare and contrast the way Asian Americans have been perceived and represented in comics.  Marvels and Monsters showcased and discussed the various character archetypes of Asian characters in comics such as the depiction of Fu Man Chu as a manifestation of Yellow Peril. The show Alt. Comics, in contrast, featured the works of 10 Asian American comic artists that offered a critique of the older representations and reiterate the way they view their changing identities in America.

2012年，美国华人博物馆推出了[两届展览](http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/past/marvels_and_monsters_and_altcomics)，以考察美国漫画中的亚裔为题。这两届展览为“奇景与怪物：揭穿美国漫画中的亚洲影像，1942-1986”与 “非传统漫画：美国亚裔艺术家重塑漫画。”它们同时的展出可深入比较漫画反映出的亚裔和对亚裔呈现出的影像。“奇景与怪物”显示了在漫画中不同的亚裔刻板角色，譬如出于黄祸时期思想的傅满洲。而“非传统漫画”展示了10位美国亚裔的作品，作品批判了经典作品中对于亚裔的描写且强调了他们对于自己不断进化的美国身份的看法。
