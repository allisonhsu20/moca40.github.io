In 2009, having outgrown the confines of 70 Mulberry street,  MOCA relocated, a few blocks away, to 215 Centre Street.  The new location, on the border of Chinatown and Soho, was designed by Chinese American architect Maya Lin. With the additional space, curators Cynthia Lee and Jack Tchen were able to expand on the museum’s core exhibition.  The improved and expanded exhibition was named With a Single Step: Stories in the making of America.  The exhibition is still on display at the museum today with small updates having been made to keep it current. The 70 Mulberry space was turned into the collections and research center, which MOCAa continued to operate until a fire in January 2020 displaced all the buildings tenants.  

2009年，美国华人博物馆，因需要比70茂比利街更大的空间，搬到了离原地址不远的215中央街。这个新低点在唐人街与苏豪区结界的位置，设计师为美国华裔林璎。有了充分的空间后，博物馆讲解员Cynthia Lee与Jack Tchen扩增了博物馆的基本陈列。扩大改良后的新展览名为《始于足下：创造美国的故事》。此展览目前仍在博物馆展出，时而会被更新。原地址70茂不利街的空间被转为一个博物馆操作的收集研究中心，直到2020年的一月份，一场大火逼走了楼中的租客。
