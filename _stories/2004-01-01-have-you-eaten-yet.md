For Chinese and Chinese Americans, the question, “Have You Eaten Yet?” is a greeting similar to “How are you?” In 2004, MOCA curated a [show](https://www.stephaniereyer.com/#/moca/) that centralized food of the Chinese American diaspora. It highlighted the ways in which Chinese immigrants to the United States brought about their legacies through opening restaurants. As part of [the exhibition](https://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/26485), menus and matchbooks were adorned with dragons, lotus flowers, and pagodas. Through restaurant memorabilia, a specific visual legacy became ingrained in the American imagination of Chinese restaurants. [The exhibition](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24556559?seq=1) highlighted that the fabrication of stereotypes was a two-way streak;Chinese restaurants presented themselves as cultural brokers to survive and their American customers stereotyped an image of China based on their experiences. Tracing a chronological history from the mid-1800s to the late 1900s, the show explored shifting attitudes towards Chinese cuisine in the United States. 

中国与华裔文化里的日常问候 “吃了吗?” 与英文中的 ”How are you?” 有着类似的用意。2004年间，美国华人博物馆筹划了一届以散居华裔饮食为标题的[展出](stephaniereyer.com/#/moca/)。此展强调了美国华裔通过餐饮业而繁衍文化遗产的现象。[展](https://international.ucla.edu/institute/article/26485)中陈列含有以飞龙，荷花，和宝塔图案为点缀的菜单与火柴盒。通过中餐馆的装饰品，一个对于中餐馆的明确印象在美国人众的想象之中呈现。[展览](www.jstor.org/stable/24556559)显示了双方性的文化刻板化；为了生存，中餐馆把自己扮为传述中国文化的中间人，而餐馆的美国客户以他们所体验的中餐馆作为对于中国文化的刻板印象。展览根据时间线从十九世纪中叶至二十世纪晚期分析美国人众对于中餐不断改变的态度。
