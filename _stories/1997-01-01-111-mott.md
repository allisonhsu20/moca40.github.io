In 1997, MOCA was able to acquire another large salvage collection.  The collection is called the “111 Mott Street” collection, named for the location the collection was acquired from.  A Chinese resident of the building had passed away and with no next of kin the landlord had thrown all of his belongings away into a dumpster.  Museum staff collected the materials and later found dozens of personal letters, and household knickknacks.  

It wasn’t until an independent researcher named Heather R Lee began digging into the collection that amazing details of a life came to light.  The artifacts belonged to a man named Shuck Wing Chin, who came to the US to earn money for his wife and child back in China.  But through the series of salvaged letters it seemed that he had stopped sending money home and instead fell in love with an American woman.  

1997年，美国华人博物馆又一次收取了大规模的文物抢救收藏。这一项收集为收藏地点名为“勿街111号,” 因为在此地址的楼房中，一位华裔住户死后无近亲，地主便把他所有遗物弃置垃圾箱。博物馆员工将此文物抢救后掘出多数私人信件与多样家中摆设。

而后，独立学者Heather R Lee开始挖掘这些文物，最后拼凑出了一个精彩的人生故事。所有物品属于一位名为Shuck Wing Chin的先生，为了赚钱支持国内的夫人孩子而赴美。但从一系列保留的信件内可见他爱上了一位美国女士后便停止了往家中寄钱。
