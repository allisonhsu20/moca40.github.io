Throughout 1997 and the earlier part of 1998, the museum began conducting a series of oral histories with Chinese that immigrated to Latin America .  Many of the interviewees would end up living in the United States and their narratives provided a unique series of experiences that had not previously been explored in depth.   Their journeys saw them adapting to two radically different cultures instead of purely trying to assimilate into US culture.  In the end, three of their stories were chosen to be exhibited at MoCA in 1998 under the exhibition “Mi Familia, Mi Comunidad.”
	
The complete collection of oral histories done for this project can be listened to in our digital database [here](http://ohms.mocanyc.org/interviews.php?ProjectName=The+Chino-Latino+Project) 

1997年至1998年年初，馆方开始一系列对拉丁美洲华裔的口述史采访。采访人士中包括从拉丁美洲搬至美国的移民人士；他们在采访中所描述得特殊经历未有过教学上的深入研究。他们诉说了适应两种差距极大的文化的旅途，与广泛同化美国的故事有所不同。其中三个故事被选中，1998年在美国华人博物馆的“我的家庭，我的社区” 展览下展出。

此项目中口完整述史收藏可以在我们的资料库[这里](http://ohms.mocanyc.org/interviews.php?ProjectName=The+Chino-Latino+Project)听到。
