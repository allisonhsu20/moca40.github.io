Throughout 1997 and the earlier part of 1998, the museum began conducting a series of oral histories with Chinese that immigrated to Latin America .  Many of the interviewees would end up living in the United States and their narratives provided a unique series of experiences that had not previously been explored in depth.   Their journeys saw them adapting to two radically different cultures instead of purely trying to assimilate into US culture.  In the end, three of their stories were chosen to be exhibited at MoCA in 1998 under the exhibition “Mi Familia, Mi Comunidad.”

1997年至1998年年初，博物馆开始一系列移民拉丁美洲华裔的口述史采访。因其中包括了从拉丁美洲搬至美国的人员，采访中描述了一种未受过研究探索的特殊经验。他们在旅途中诉说了适应两种差距极大的文化的经验，与普通的同化美国的故事有所不同。其中三个故事被选中，1998年在美国华人博物馆的“我的家庭，我的社区” 展览下展出。
此项目中口完整述史收藏可以在我们的资料库[这里](http://ohms.mocanyc.org/interviews.php?ProjectName=The+Chino-Latino+Project))听到：
