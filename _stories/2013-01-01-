[Shanghai Glamour: New Women 1910-40s](
http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/current/shanghai_glamour) was guest curated by Mei Mei Rado and displayed at MOCA in 2013. The show explored how Shanghai women and their archetypes were crucial to the formation of the new city’s identity. During the time period, the dress and manner of Shanghai women became emblems of the city’s modernization. The evolution of Shanghai women opened controversial discussions about the changing social and political scene as well as gender roles. The show featured outfits from the China National Silk Museum in Hangzhou and private collections from New York City. These outfits were contextualized with accessories, paper ephemera, and photographs. The show explores the many perceived archetypes popular in Shanghai at the time-- the student, socialite, courtesan, movie star, artist, dancing girl, and housewife — to reconstruct the social and cultural pulses behind the many facets of Shanghai glamour.

[《上海的魅力：新女人 1910-40年代》](
http://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/current/shanghai_glamour)是一项2013年在美国华人博物馆推出的展览，以客席策展人Mei Mei Rado讲解。此展探索了上海女性的典型形象在创造过程中新上海的关键影响。上海女人的穿着与风范在这个时期成为了对于上海现代化的一种标志。上海女性的进化开启了关于社会政治变化与性别角色观念的争议。此展陈列含有杭州中国丝绸博物馆和纽约私人收藏中的服装。配饰，印制品，和照片引入了服装的背景。此展探讨了当代上海流行的经典造型--学生，社交名媛，艺妓，影星，艺术家，舞女，和妇人--且重建了当年上海繁华魅力之后的社会与文化脉搏。
