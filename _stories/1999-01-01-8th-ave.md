In the 1980s new Chinese immigrants to New York began to settle on 8th Avenue in Brooklyn rather than the already established Manhattan Chinatown.  This community slowly grew throughout the 80s and 90s and is now seen as one of the three major Chinatowns in the five boroughs.  In 1999 MOCA worked with the Brooklyn Historical Society to explore the growth of this new community.  Together the two institutions put up the show “A good place to land one’s feet: Brooklyn’s new Chinese community.”  

While the exhibition happened in 1999 the two institutions had their eyes on the blossoming new Chinatown of Sunset Park in Brooklyn.  In 1993 the two organizations began jointly documenting the neighborhood by conducting a series of oral histories with the residents.  A selection of those oral histories can be found in [MOCA’s online database](http://ohms.mocanyc.org/interviews.php?ProjectName=8th+Avenue+-+Sunset+Park+Oral+History+Collection)

八十年代移民纽约的华裔开始在布鲁克林区的八号大街安家，选择了已建立的华人社区--曼哈顿唐人街—之外的地点。这个新社区在八九十年代渐渐发展，至今已被人们认定为纽约五个行政区中三个大型唐人街之一。美国华人博物馆在1999年与布鲁克林历史学会合作研究此新社区的发展。两所机构即联合推出了“良好的落脚之地: 布鲁克林的心华人社区”。

1999年，此展成功推出，而两所机构同时把视线投射到了布鲁克林新唐人街生机勃勃的日落公园。从1993起，两所机构，通过对当地居民的一系列的口述历史采访，开始了记载这片小区的合作。口述历史特选可在[美国华人博物馆网络资料库查看](http://ohms.mocanyc.org/interviews.php?ProjectName=8th+Avenue+-+Sunset+Park+Oral+History+Collection)
