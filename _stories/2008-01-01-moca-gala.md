The 2008 MOCA gala dinner celebrated the inaugural opening season of the new museum space at 215 Centre Street.  At the 2008 gala, the museum also gave out its first lifetime achievement award to architect I.M. Pei.  The award was given to recognize exemplary individuals and institutions whose distinguished achievements advance the Chinese/Chinese American society, improve humanity, and inspire all people.   Pei and his firm have notably worked on buildings such as the Bank of China in Hong Kong, the Hancock Building in Chicago, the Jacob Javits Center in New York, and The Louvre in Paris.    Other notable recipients of the award have been scholar Wan-Go Weng, Starr Foundation Chairman Maurice Greenberg, and banker Pei-Yuan Chia.
