[The Chinatown Film Project](http://www.mocanyc.org/visit/events/chinatown_film_project) launched by MOCA in 2007. Chinatowns are often seen in many forms of media but are always depicted stereotypically.  The project was aimed to subvert these popular biases and reveal stories of the families who still thrive in Chinatown. Ten New York-based filmmakers were asked to create short films that presented their visions of Chinatown. The museum also invited the community to share their own stories documenting their local Chinatowns. Together the films were meant to show that Chinatowns are not just Hollywood metaphors but in reality a place where people live, work, and play.  

美国华人博物馆在2007年推出了[唐人街影片项目](http://www.mocanyc.org/visit/events/chinatown_film_project)。唐人街经常出现在格式媒体的作品里，但主要描述非常刻板化。这一项目的目标乃为抗衡这种普遍偏见而描述在唐人街茁壮成长的人们与家庭。十位纽约电影制片人被请来创作短片，题目为他们个人眼中的唐人街。 博物馆也邀请了唐人街社区众人来分享他们的故事与个人的地方性唐人街。这一系列短篇中展示了不仅是好莱坞隐喻中的唐人街，而是一个人们真实生活，工作，和玩耍的地方。
