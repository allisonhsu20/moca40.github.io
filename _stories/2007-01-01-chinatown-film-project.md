[The Chinatown Film Project](http://www.mocanyc.org/visit/events/chinatown_film_project) launched by MOCA in 2007. Chinatowns are often seen in many forms of media but are always depicted stereotypically.  The project was aimed to subvert these popular biases and reveal stories of the families who still thrive in Chinatown. Ten New York-based filmmakers were asked to create short films that presented their visions of Chinatown. The museum also invited the community to share their own stories documenting their local Chinatowns. Together the films were meant to show that Chinatowns are not just Hollywood metaphors but in reality a place where people live, work, and play.  

美国华人博物馆在2007年推出了["唐人街影片项目。"](http://www.mocanyc.org/visit/events/chinatown_film_project)唐人街的形象经常出现在格式媒体作品中，但对唐人街的主流描述非常刻板化。此项目的目标就是抗衡这种普遍含有偏见的印象，同时描述在唐人街茁壮成长的人们与家庭。十位纽约地区的电影制片人被请来创作短片，题目是“他们个人眼中的唐人街。” 博物馆也邀请了唐人街社群人众来分享他们的故事以及个人心中的唐人街。这一系列短篇展示的不仅仅是好莱坞隐喻中的唐人街，而也是一个人们真正在生活，工作，和玩耍的地方。
