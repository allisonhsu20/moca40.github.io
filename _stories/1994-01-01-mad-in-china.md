In 1994 the museum held an exhibition entitled “Made in China: Photographs of American Chinatown” that featured a series of photographs by Taiwan born photographer Chien Chi-Chang.  During the time Chien was an active documentarian of Manhattan’s Chinatown.  In this show he tried to show the daily lives of the residents of these ethnic enclaves living through a sense of alienation from their mother country and their adopted home.  He went on to join Magnum Photos and continues to document the abstract concept of alienation.
