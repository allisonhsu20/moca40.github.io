In 2016, MOCA presented [Stage Design by Ming Cho Lee](https://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/stage_design_by_ming_cho_lee), a retrospective that celebrated the influential set designer. Lee is known for his groundbreaking abstract design sets of the 1960s and 70s to his more recent hard-edge treatments. [The exhibition](https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/us/2016-05/13/content_25267693.htm) followed Lee’s artistic career through more than 40 original maquettes, sketches, and photographic reproductions. He has shared his knowledge in theater, opera and dance through his work at Yale School of Drama for over 65 years. As a recipient of the Tony Award for lifetime achievement in 2013, Ming Cho Lee is one of the most acclaimed set designers in the U.S.

美国华人博物馆在2016年推出了[“李名觉的舞台设计，”](https://www.mocanyc.org/exhibitions/stage_design_by_ming_cho_lee)通过此回顾展纪念了这位颇有影响力舞台设计师。李先生以他60至70年代的抽象布景设计方面的突破和他近代的硬边风格为名。[此展](https://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/us/2016-05/13/content_25267693.htm)利用了四十多个原作品—其中含有设计模型、素描、和影印—勾勒了他一生的艺术职业。他在耶鲁戏剧学院传授了65年的戏剧，歌剧，和舞蹈方面的今生经理。作为2013年托尼终生成就奖的获奖人，李明觉无疑是美国最受赞誉的布景设计师之一。
