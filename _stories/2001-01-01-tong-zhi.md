Sexuality is an issue that is seldom discussed openly within the Asian community; this holds especially true in regards to homosexuality.  In 2001 artist Ken Chu worked with MOCA to put on an exhibition called “Tong Zhi/Comrades: Out in Asia America.”  For the show, Chu brought together 20 gay men of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage and recorded their stories and used those details to create posters of each participant that resembled the front page of a newspaper.  Each poster was printed in editions of 100 and stacked on tables at the museum for display.

性别在亚裔社会中是一件让人忌讳的话题，尤其是同性恋方面的问题。艺术家Ken Chu在2001年与美国华人博物馆的合作下推出了“同志：在亚裔美国表明同性身份”。Chu的展览采用了二十个东亚裔与东南亚族裔男同性恋的故事，以报纸首页样板形式为每个参与项目的人选设计了一张个人海报。每张海报印出100张，堆叠在博物馆桌上展出。
