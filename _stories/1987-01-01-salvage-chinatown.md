Fay Chiang was the daughter of a paper son; her father immigrated to the United States to work in a laundry at ten years old. She found it difficult to communicate with her immigrant parents as they rarely spoke to their coming of age stories. When her father passed away, Chiang looked through the salvages of her parents’ past. These instances of Chaing’s were commonplace for many second generation Chinese Americans. In the 1980s, New York Chinatown History Project asked community members for family memorabilia to record the 100-year-old history. The collection resulted in the 1987 show, [Salvaging New York Chinatown: Preserving a Heritage](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/a-new-exhibition-on-old-chinatown-is-enhanced-by-families-artifacts.html) curated by Dorothy Rony. 

Fay Chiang 是一位契纸儿子的女儿；她的父亲十岁移民了美国，在一家洗衣店中工作。她在与自己移民父母在沟通上感到困难，因父母从对自己的成长经历一字不提。她父亲去世之后，Chiang为了了解父母的过去而翻阅了他们留下的物件。Chiang的经历是许多第二代华裔都拥有过的亲身体验。1980年代时，纽约华埠历史研究社曾向社群征求他们捐出家中的纪念物，以此记录唐人街的百年历史。此收集后而成为了1987年以Dorothy Rony策划的展出，["挽救纽约唐人街：保存历史遗产。"](https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/nyregion/a-new-exhibition-on-old-chinatown-is-enhanced-by-families-artifacts.html)
