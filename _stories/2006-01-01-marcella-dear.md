In 2006 MOCA acquired its single largest collection, which was donated by longtime Chinatown resident Marcella B. Chin Dear.  The Chin family came to New York in 1800s and established a series of successful business ventures.  The most well known being the Rice Bowl Restaurant, which was touted as one of the first Chinese restaurants in Manhattan’s Chinatown to have air conditioning. 
  
Marcella’s father had saved his family artifacts with the intention of opening a family museum but when he passed away, his daughter donated the collection to MOCA.  The collection is around 150 linear feet and contains textiles, imported books, vinyl records, game sets, instruments, family photographs, store signs, ceramics, and furniture. These artifacts document the life of a multigenerational Chinese American family in the United States. 

2006年，美国华人博物馆收到了博物馆最大的一项收集，以久居唐人街的谢陈雪瑛捐纳。陈家以十九世纪迁至纽约，后开启了一系列成功的企业。其中最知名的企业乃是Rice Bowl Restaurant, 一家被称为曼哈顿唐人街第一家又空调的中餐馆。

陈雪瑛的父亲积存的家中物品的本意是创作一所家庭博物馆，可他过世时，他的女儿把收藏品皆捐给了美国华人博物馆。收集概括了约莫46米长的空间， 内含纺织品，进口书籍，唱片，成套游戏，乐器，家庭照，店牌，陶瓷器，和家具。这些文物记录了一多代美国华裔家庭在美国的生活。
