[Archivist of the “Yellow Peril”: Yoshio Kishi Collecting for a New America](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/nyregion/thecity/in-a-west-side-apartment-a-world.html) opened at MOCA in 2005.  [The show](https://www.asianconnections.com/item/-7) was co-curated by MOCA founder Jack Tchen.  The “Yellow Peril” moniker was derived from a 19th century phrase that originated from the supposed threat of the Asian diaspora to Anglo Americans. This trope was popularized through the media with fictional character such as Fu Manchu.  The show displayed various artifacts of Asian Americana from the personal collections of film editor, Yoshio Kishi and actress Yah Ling Sun. The collection examines perceived identities of Asians and Asian Americans based around unflattering stereotypes in American literature, popular media, and paper ephemera.  

To combat the negative depictions, Yishi also collected ephemera based around Asian American reflections on their own identity. These materials served to juxtapose the negative depictions in the exhibition. Notably, the Basement Workshop published the art book Yellow Pearl (1976), which showcased poetry, drawings, and sheet music from a collective of Asian American artists and activists.  

[“‘黄祸’收藏家: Yoshio Kishi 新美国收藏”](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/nyregion/thecity/in-a-west-side-apartment-a-world.html)2005年在美国华人博物馆开展。[展览](https://www.asianconnections.com/item/-7)以美国华人博物馆创始人Jack Tchen联合策展。“黄祸“这个概念起于英美人众因十九世纪亚裔移民现象而收到得威胁感。“黄祸”这个概念以格式媒体推广，例如英国小说中的反面角色傅满洲。此展包含了Yoshio Kishi 与演员Yah Ling Sun 私人收藏中的许多美国亚裔文物。此系列文物对美国文学，主流媒体，和印刷作品中产生对亚裔得偏见与负面刻板影响进行了检验。
  
为了抗衡这些负面影响，Kishi也收藏了以美国亚裔所创造的作品。这些作品得主要内容涉及到作者对自己亚裔身份得感想。这些作品与有着负面描写的作品在展中成立了强烈的对比性。值得注意的另一点是地下工作室出版的《黄色珍珠》(1976)艺术书籍；书的内容包含了亚裔艺术家与激进主义分子的诗词，绘画，和乐谱。
