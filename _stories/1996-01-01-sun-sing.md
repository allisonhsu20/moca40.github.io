In the 60s and 70s, Chinese movie theaters were prevalent in Manhattan’s Chinatown, usually serving as places for members of the community to gather and reclaim a sense of home by watching films in their mother tongue.  But with the rise of technology and the ability to watch films and television at home, the theaters saw a sharp decline in the late 80s and early 90s.  In 1993, Sun Sing theater located on East Broadway shuttered and remained unoccupied for a time.  

In 1996, our staff at MOCA was notified that the East Broadway location had a new tenant and was thus allowed by the city to go in for a short period of time to salvage some materials for our collection.  It was during this operation that the museum was able to build our Sun Sing Theater collection, which consists of movie posters, theater staff photographs, account books, theater newsletters, etc.  

在美国的六十与七十年代，中国影院在曼哈顿的唐人街广布开放，成为许多社区成员一起中文影片而回味家乡感觉的地点。但因八九十年代的技术发展，大众普遍在家中观看影片节目导致了影院渐渐衰落。1993年，在东百老汇上大街的声新影院停业后暂时放空。

1996年美国华人博物馆得知声新影院在东百老汇大街的原地点将有新承租户，而从市政府得到了从内收集旧物的允许。这一次行动建造了我们现在的声新影院收藏，之内包括了电影海报，影院员工的相片，账本，影院通讯，等等。
