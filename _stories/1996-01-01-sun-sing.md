In the 60s and 70s, Chinese movie theaters were prevalent in Manhattan’s Chinatown, usually serving as places for members of the community to gather and reclaim a sense of home by watching films in their mother tongue.  But with the rise of technology and the ability to watch films and television at home, the theaters saw a sharp decline in the late 80s and early 90s.  In 1993, Sun Sing theater located on East Broadway shuttered and remained unoccupied for a time.  

In 1996, our staff at MOCA was notified that the East Broadway location had a new tenant and was thus allowed by the city to go in for a short period of time to salvage some materials for our collection.  It was during this operation that the museum was able to build our Sun Sing Theater collection, which consists of movie posters, theater staff photographs, account books, theater newsletters, etc.  

美国60至70年代期间，中国影院在曼哈顿的唐人街生意兴旺，成为了许多社区成员一起享受中文影片而回味家乡的地点。但因80年代的技术发展，大众普遍转为在家中观看影片节目，导致了影院的渐渐衰落。1993年，东百老汇大街上的声新影院停业后暂时放空。

美国华人博物馆在1996年得知了声新影院在东百老汇大街的原地址将有新承租户，而从市政府得到了允许从内采集文物。这一次行动建造了我们现在的声“新影院收藏,”内容包括电影海报，影院员工的相片，账本，影院通讯，等等文物。
