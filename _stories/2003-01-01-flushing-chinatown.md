Flushing’s Chinatown is one of three major Chinese communities in New York’s five boroughs.  The community began to flourish in the 1970s when Mandarin speaking Taiwanese immigrants began coming to New York.  They felt largely alienated by Manhattan’s Chinatown, which largely spoke Cantonese.  As the community grew other groups of Mandarin speaking immigrants also began migrating to Flushing and the neighborhood continues to grow.  In 2003, MOCA worked with 3 photographers to document the Chinese community in Flushing.  These works were presented at the museum in an exhibition called “Main Street, Flushing, USA.”

法拉盛的唐人街是纽约五个行政区中三大华人区之一。随着说国语的台湾移民迁至纽约城，法拉盛的华人区从70年代开始繁荣。这些台湾移民大多感受到了被曼哈顿的粤语的社区疏远。在法拉盛华人区的发展下，其他普通话的华裔也迁至了法拉盛。2003年，美国华裔博物馆在与三位摄影师的何须哦下记录了法拉盛的华人社区。此作品在博物馆展出为《缅街，法拉盛，USA》
