The attacks of September 11th, 2001 devastated the nation. Being close to ground zero, Manhattan’s Chinatown was also brought to a standstill.  After the dust literally and figuratively cleared, the neighborhood had to rebuild.  This rebuilding effort became a part of the history of the community and MOCA collected stories, pictures, and artifacts of the process from 2001 to 2002.  Some of the more powerful artifacts in this collection included a series of notebooks containing recollections of middle school and high school students of that fateful morning.  The materials collected were displayed later in an [online exhibition](http://911chinatown.mocanyc.org/) that can still be viewed today.

2001年的九一一恐怖袭击事件让全美人民收到了前所未有的惊吓。因离原爆点距离很近，曼哈顿唐人街也因此事件进入了停顿状态。在一切灰尘落地后， 周围的街坊邻里需要重新修建。这一次修建成为了唐人街社区的一段历史，而美国华人博物馆从2001-2002年间收集了许多故事，图片，与相关的文物。收集品其中让人影响深刻的文物包括了一系列中学生们回忆九一一事件当天早晨笔记。此次收集的文物而后将被博物馆放入[网站](http://911chinatown.mocanyc.org/)上展出，至今亦在。
