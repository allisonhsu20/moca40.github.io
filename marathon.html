MOCA welcomes you to join us as an official charity runner at the 50th anniversary of the TCS NYC Marathon on November 1, 2020! We make nearly 200 years of Chinese American history accessible to the general public, from scholars to young children and from community members to international tourists. When your efforts to cross the finish line also enable MOCA to: redefine the American narrative to include the Chinese American experience through art, history, and community. Please send a brief statement of your interest in joining Team MOCA 40 to mocaspike150@mocanyc.org. We look forward to running with you as a team!
