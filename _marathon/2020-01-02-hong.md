I just got MOCA's email about the MOCA 2020 NYC Marathon team. I live in New York and became connected to MOCA after the fire around Chinese New Year. As a Chinese American, it saddened me to see this happen after also seeing COVID-19 ramp up in Asia. Seeing the xenophobia that has emerged since then has been saddening and it would be great to represent MOCA during this time. Also, based on your email address and the 150th anniversary of the Golden Spike last year, I wanted to mention that my great-great-grandfather worked on the railroad. I was born and raised in Salt Lake City and had the opportunity to revisit the Golden Spike with my father when I passed through Utah last year.

I have run one marathon so far, the Philadelphia Marathon in 2016. I've unsuccessfully entered the NYC Marathon lottery in the years since and have filled my time with running half marathons instead. It would be great to train for the NYC Marathon and represent an organization I believe in.
