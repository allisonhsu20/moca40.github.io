[Catherine Hu](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/mocamarathon2020/CatherineHu)'s statement:
My parents are first-generation immigrants from China and most of my extended family still live back in China. I am very proud of my heritage, and have visited China often since I was a child. I am currently pursuing graduate studies in psychology and aim to pursue research that adds to the field of knowledge about intergroup relations, bias, and prejudice -- including drawing attention to the difficulties that Chinese-Americans have faced and continue to face today in America. 

The experiences I have had have taught me the importance of respecting my background and everything that paved the way to make my life as it is possible today. The history of Chinese immigrants in America is a big part of that background and I was devastated to hear of the likely loss of invaluable items in the museum's archives in the fire last month. While money cannot replace history, it could certainly help in other areas such as preservation/digitization of remaining archives, and I would love to contribute however I can. 

More about me: in my early twenties, I was diagnosed with chronic migraine and fibromyalgia. Since then, I have made my way through the healthcare system seeking ways to manage my symptoms. Luckily, last year, things started to look up, and I picked up running as a way to challenge myself to push beyond what my body thinks it can do. I ran my first 10k last October, am training for my first half-marathon in April, and hope to run my first marathon in the second half of this year. It would be an honor to be able to expand my journey beyond just my own health, and to represent and raise money for MOCA in November at the TCS NYC Marathon.
