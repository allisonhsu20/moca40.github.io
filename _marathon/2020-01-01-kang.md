In support of MOCA, I am dedicating my races in 2019 to MOCA's fund-raising campaign. I have completed the New Jersey State Marathon in April, New Jersey State Triathlon in July, Garden State Fondo (105 miles Gran) in September, and will soon attempt to reach my BQ goal in Chicago Marathon on October 13th.  I pledge to raise $2000 for MOCA by November 3rd, when a large group of runners participate in New York City Marathon and Princeton Half Marathon in support of MOCA.
