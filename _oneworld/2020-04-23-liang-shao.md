Dr. Liang Shao, a clinical psychologist at New York City hospitals, honors the volunteers who flew in to help with the emergency situation in New York caused by the Covid-19 pandemic through a poem he composed. The poem, titled “The Love of Angels,” expresses his deep gratitude to the volunteers in a moment of solidarity during the fight against Covid-19. 

The Love of Angels

You have gone today, <br/>
Perhaps you will come again;<br/>
In New York’s twilight, you arrive in a hurry, <br/>
Against New York’s dusk, you quietly depart.<br/> 

We cannot see your face, <br/>
But we can see your shining eyes;<br/>
We cannot understand the cadence of <br/>the respirator,<br/>
But we can hear your faint sigh. <br/>

Every screech of the emergency alarm, <br/>
We see your determined face,<br/> 
Every time we wake,<br/>
Your fatigued silhouette disappea<br/>rs in the corridor.<br/> 

You’re the silent hero in our minds, <br/>
You’re the gentle angel in our hearts, <br/>
Your composed conviction, your thanksgiving and guardianship, <br/>
In the darkness, you held my hand for eternity.<br/>

You’re the twilight on the horizon, <br/>
You are New York’s hope, <br/>
Because of you, the virus cannot run rampant, <br/>
Because of you, endows light upon life as we know it. <br/>

   天使的爱

今天你走了，<br/>
也许你会再来；<br/>
纽约的霞光中，你匆匆而来，<br/>
纽约的夜幕下，你悄然离开。<br/>

看不到你的脸，<br/>
但看到你明亮的眼；<br/>
看不懂呼吸机的起伏，<br/>
但听到了你的轻叹。<br/>

每一次急救的呼叫，<br/>
看到你坚毅的脸；<br/>
每一次醒来，<br/>
你疲惫的身影消失在走廊边。<br/>

你是我们心中沉默的英雄，<br/>
你是我们心中温柔的天使；<br/>
你淡定从容，感恩守护，<br/>
黑暗中，你永远握着了我的手。<br/>


你就是天边的霞光，<br/>
你就是纽约的希望；<br/>
因为有你，病毒难以嚣张，<br/>
因为有你，生命有了光亮。<br/>
