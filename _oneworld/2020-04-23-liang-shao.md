Dr. Liang Shao, a clinical psychologist at New York City hospitals, honors the volunteers who flew in to help with the emergency situation in New York caused by the Covid-19 pandemic through a poem he composed. The poem, titled “The Love of Angels,” expresses his deep gratitude to the volunteers in a moment of solidarity during the fight against Covid-19. 

The Love of Angels

You have gone today, 
Perhaps you will come again;
In New York’s twilight, you arrive in a hurry, 
Against New York’s dusk, you quietly depart. 

We cannot see your face, 
But we can see your shining eyes;
We cannot understand the cadence of the respirator, 
But we can hear your faint sigh. 

Every screech of the emergency alarm, 
We see your determined face, 
Every time we wake,
Your fatigued silhouette disappears in the corridor. 

You’re the silent hero in our minds, 
You’re the gentle angel in our hearts, 
Your composed conviction, your thanksgiving and guardianship, 
In the darkness, you held my hand for eternity. 

You’re the twilight on the horizon, 
You are New York’s hope, 
Because of you, the virus cannot run rampant, 
Because of you, endows light upon life as we know it. 

   天使的爱

今天你走了，
也许你会再来；
纽约的霞光中，你匆匆而来，
纽约的夜幕下，你悄然离开。

看不到你的脸，
但看到你明亮的眼；
看不懂呼吸机的起伏，
但听到了你的轻叹。

每一次急救的呼叫，
看到你坚毅的脸；
每一次醒来，
你疲惫的身影消失在走廊边。

你是我们心中沉默的英雄，
你是我们心中温柔的天使；
你淡定从容，感恩守护，
黑暗中，你永远握着了我的手。

你就是天边的霞光，
你就是纽约的希望；
因为有你，病毒难以嚣张，
因为有你，生命有了光亮。
