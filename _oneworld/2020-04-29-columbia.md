Thomas Lo, an anesthesiologist at Montefiore Nyack Hospital in New York, witnessed the massive PPE shortages firsthand as COVID-10 ravaged the city.  Rather than sit idly by, Lo decided to act and reached out to colleagues from his alma mater through his connections with Columbia Universityâ€™s Alumni Association, which has many chapters in China.  Through his efforts and the generous donations of members of the association Lo was able to raise over $1 million dollars and purchase over 11,000 N95 masks that were donated to various hospitals throughout Ne York.
