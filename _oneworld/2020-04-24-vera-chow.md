[Vera Chow](https://www.instagram.com/verachowdesigns/), costume designer and illustrator, has struggled as an artist due to the detrimental economic impact of Covid-19. Though she has lost her previous job as a film and television designer, she has discovered renewed purpose in doing artwork for Table to Table NYC and #WashTheHate, both organized events which concentrate on anti-Asian hatred sparked by Covid-19. Her [website](https://verachow.com/) shows samples of her previous work as well as her colorful illustrations. Interestingly, one set of illustrations she did is of Perry Yung the flute-maker, who also made a submission to MOCA as a part of our OneWorld project.
