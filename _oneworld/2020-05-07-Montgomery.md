Montgomery is a small town in central New Jersey.  Led by Xiaoyi Wu and Cari Deng, $15872.07 was donated by 160 Chinese American families in one day in response to the increasingly intense Covid-19 situation in New Jersey, the Garden State next to New York City.  Before the Governor issued the Stay At Home notice, the Montgomery Chinese Community, with the help of Ke Ke Studio LLC, successfully purchased and sent 12,500 medical masks to hospitals, local rescue centers and Police stations in just six days.  This donation was regarded as one of the earliest and largest donations of PPE from the local community voluntary groups in NJ.

Montgomery resident Charlie Wu drew a timeline of this six-day effort, and she summarized that this was such a meaningful effort of hundreds of Chinese American families in Montgomery, showing their sense of responsibilities, their support and their trust during the crisis. 

This effort evoked messages of thanks from not only the institutions themselves but grateful medical personnel and members of the Chinese-American community. Despite the struggles of Covid-19 in March of 2020, a ray of hope can be found in those like the Montgomery Chinese Community who came to the aid of the community in times of crisis.
